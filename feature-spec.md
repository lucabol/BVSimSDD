**Feature Branch**: `001-bvsim-volleyball-simulator`  
**Created**: 2025-07-24  
**Status**: Draft  

---

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## Executive Summary *(mandatory)*

BVSim is a shot-by-shot beach volleyball point simulator that allows users to define team characteristics through conditional probability distributions based on game context and run statistical analysis to determine competitive advantages. The system models realistic volleyball scenarios where skill success rates depend on previous actions (e.g., attack success after good set vs. poor set), providing insights into which contextual abilities have the greatest impact on winning points.

## Problem Statement *(mandatory)*

Beach volleyball coaches and analysts lack quantitative tools to understand which specific skills and scenarios have the greatest impact on point outcomes. Without this insight, training time and effort may be spent on less impactful areas rather than the skills that most significantly influence match results.

---

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Stories (must have)

- **US-001**: As a beach volleyball coach, I want to define two teams with conditional skill probabilities for both serving and receiving team states so that I can model realistic team matchups
  - **Happy Path**: Select team A → Define serving states (serve: ace/in-play/error rates) → Define receiving states (receive: excellent/good/poor/error rates) → Define attacking states conditional on set quality → Define defensive states (block/dig) conditional on opponent attack → Save team profile → Repeat for team B with their own serving/receiving/attacking/defensive probabilities
  - **Edge Case**: Invalid probability values (>100% or <0%) should be rejected; conditional probabilities for each team state and previous condition must sum to 100%
  - **Test**: Create two teams where Team A has different serving probabilities than receiving probabilities, verify all team-specific conditional probability distributions sum correctly

- **US-002**: As an analyst, I want to simulate thousands of points between two teams so that I can gather statistically significant data on win rates
  - **Happy Path**: Select two teams → Set simulation count to 10,000 → Run simulation → View results showing team A wins 6,247 points (62.47%) vs team B wins 3,753 points (37.53%)
  - **Edge Case**: Handle simulation interruption or system resource constraints during long simulations
  - **Test**: Run 1,000 point simulation and verify total points equals input count and percentages sum to 100%

- **US-003**: As a coach, I want to review individual point progressions so that I can verify the state machine accurately represents beach volleyball rules with distinct serving and receiving team states
  - **Happy Path**: View point log → See "Team A: Serve (Ace)" OR "Team A: Serve (In Play)" → "Team B: Receive (Good)" → "Team B: Set (Excellent)" → "Team B: Attack (Kill)" → "Team B wins point" → Verify sequence follows volleyball rules and team state transitions
  - **Edge Case**: Identify any impossible state transitions (e.g., serving team attacking immediately after serve without ball crossing net, or wrong team performing action)
  - **Test**: Generate 100 sample points and manually verify each follows valid volleyball progression with correct team state assignments

### Secondary User Stories (nice to have)

- **US-004**: As an analyst, I want to perturb individual conditional probabilities to identify the most impactful contextual skills on win rate
  - **Journey**: Select baseline teams → Choose conditional skill to vary (e.g., attack success after good sets) → Run sensitivity analysis across range → View impact chart showing how context-specific skills affect outcomes
  - **Test**: Verify that changing attack success after good sets from 70% to 90% produces different impact than changing attack success after poor sets by same amount

- **US-005**: As a coach, I want to compare multiple team configurations side-by-side so that I can evaluate different strategic approaches
  - **Journey**: Create team variants → Run parallel simulations → View comparative win rate table
  - **Test**: Create 3 team variants and verify results display in sortable comparison format

### Critical Test Scenarios
- **Error Recovery**: System continues gracefully when simulation parameters produce edge cases (e.g., 0% serve success rate)
- **Performance**: 10,000 point simulation completes within 30 seconds on standard hardware
- **Data Integrity**: Point progression logs accurately reflect state machine transitions without inconsistencies

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST implement a state machine with distinct states for serving team actions (serve, counterattack, block, dig) and receiving team actions (receive, set, attack, dig) throughout point progression
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow users to define team characteristics as conditional probability distributions where each skill's success rate depends on the quality/outcome of the previous action
- **FR-003**: System MUST simulate individual points by traversing the state machine using team-specific probabilities
- **FR-004**: System MUST track and display win statistics across large numbers of simulated points
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide detailed logs of individual point progressions for verification
- **FR-006**: System MUST validate that all conditional probability distributions for each team sum to 100% for each previous state condition (e.g., attack probabilities after good set must sum to 100%, attack probabilities after poor set must sum to 100%)
- **FR-007**: System MUST maintain team role context throughout the point, ensuring only the appropriate team can perform each action (e.g., only serving team can serve, only receiving team can receive serve, teams alternate offense/defense roles)
- **FR-008**: System MUST support sensitivity analysis by varying individual team parameters
- **FR-009**: System MUST maintain state context throughout point progression to enable conditional probability lookups (e.g., track that previous action was "Good Set" to apply correct attack probability distribution)
- **FR-010**: System MUST enforce correct team alternation in point flow (serve → receive → offense/defense transitions) and prevent invalid team state sequences (e.g., same team cannot serve and immediately attack without ball crossing net)

### Key Entities
- **Team**: Represents a beach volleyball team with conditional probability distributions for each skill scenario, where success rates depend on previous action quality (e.g., attack success rates vary based on set quality, defense success varies based on attack type)
- **Point**: Single volleyball point progression from serve to conclusion, containing sequence of state transitions
- **State Machine**: Defines all possible states and transitions with explicit team assignments (Team A: Serve, Team B: Receive/Set/Attack, Team A: Block/Dig, Team B: Set/Attack, etc.) ensuring realistic volleyball flow
- **Simulation**: Collection of simulated points between two teams with aggregate statistics
- **Conditional Probability Matrix**: For each team-specific skill, defines outcome probabilities based on previous state. Examples:
  - **Team A Serve**: Ace=10%, In Play=85%, Error=5%
  - **Team B Receive** (after Team A In-Play Serve): Excellent=30%, Good=50%, Poor=15%, Error=5%
  - **Team B Attack** (after Team B Excellent Set): Kill=90%, Error=5%, Defended=5%
  - **Team A Block** (against Team B Attack): Stuff=20%, Deflection=30%, No Touch=50%
  - **Team A Dig** (after Team A No-Touch Block): Excellent=25%, Good=45%, Poor=25%, Error=5%

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: 10,000 point simulation completes within 60 seconds
- **Scale**: Supports team probability matrices with up to 50 distinct state transitions
- **Reliability**: Simulation results are deterministic when using same random seed
- **Constraints**: Must accurately model beach volleyball rules without impossible state transitions
