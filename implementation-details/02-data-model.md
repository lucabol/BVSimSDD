    action: str        # "serve", "receive", "set", "attack", "block", "dig"
    quality: str       # "excellent", "good", "poor", "error", "ace", "kill", etc.
    touch_count: int   # Current touch number for the team

    winner: str             # "A" or "B"
    point_type: str         # "ace", "kill", "error", "block", etc.
    duration_states: int    # Number of state transitions
    
    def add_state(self, state: State) -> None:
        """Add state transition to point progression"""
        
    def is_valid(self) -> bool:
        """Validate point follows volleyball rules"""
        
    def to_dict(self) -> dict:
        """Convert point to dictionary for JSON serialization"""
```

### Simulation
```python
@dataclass
class Simulation:
    id: str
    team_a: Team
    team_b: Team
    points: List[Point]
    team_a_score: int
    team_b_score: int
    total_points: int
    
    def add_point(self, point: Point) -> None:
        """Add completed point to simulation"""

        """Generate comprehensive simulation statistics"""
        
    def to_dict(self) -> dict:
        """Convert simulation to dictionary for JSON serialization"""
```

### ConditionalProbabilityMatrix
```python
@dataclass
class ConditionalProbabilityMatrix:
    team_name: str
    probabilities: Dict[str, Dict[str, Dict[str, float]]]
    # Structure: {state_type: {previous_condition: {outcome: probability}}}
    
    def get_probability(self, state_type: str, condition: str, outcome: str) -> float:
        """Get probability for specific outcome given condition"""
        
    def validate_matrix(self) -> List[str]:
        """Validate all probability distributions sum to 1.0"""
```

## Validation Rules

### Probability Distribution Validation
- All probability dictionaries must sum to 1.0 (Â±0.001 tolerance)
- Individual probabilities must be between 0.0 and 1.0
- Required outcomes must be present for each state type

### State Transition Validation
- Team alternation after ball crosses net
- Maximum 3 touches per team per possession
- Valid state sequences only (no impossible transitions)
- Proper point conclusion conditions

### Team Configuration Validation
- All required probability matrices present
- Conditional probabilities cover all possible previous states
- Team names must be unique and non-empty

## YAML Schema

### Team Configuration Schema
```yaml
name: "string"
serve_probabilities:
  ace: 0.0-1.0          # number [0-1]
  in_play: 0.0-1.0      # number [0-1]
  error: 0.0-1.0        # number [0-1]

receive_probabilities:
  in_play_serve:
    excellent: 0.0-1.0  # number [0-1]
    good: 0.0-1.0       # number [0-1]
    poor: 0.0-1.0       # number [0-1]
    error: 0.0-1.0      # number [0-1]

attack_probabilities:
  excellent_set:
    kill: 0.0-1.0       # number [0-1]
    error: 0.0-1.0      # number [0-1]
    defended: 0.0-1.0   # number [0-1]
  good_set:
    kill: 0.0-1.0
    error: 0.0-1.0
    defended: 0.0-1.0
  poor_set:
    kill: 0.0-1.0
    error: 0.0-1.0
    defended: 0.0-1.0

# Additional probability matrices for block, dig, etc.
block_probabilities:
  power_attack:
    stuff: 0.0-1.0
    deflection: 0.0-1.0
    no_touch: 0.0-1.0

dig_probabilities:
  deflected_attack:
    excellent: 0.0-1.0
    good: 0.0-1.0
    poor: 0.0-1.0
    error: 0.0-1.0
```

## Performance Considerations

- Use dataclasses for minimal memory overhead
- Implement efficient probability lookup (O(1) dictionary access)
- YAML serialization for human-readable team configs, JSON for simulation results
- Lazy validation to avoid repeated probability sum checks
- PyYAML safe_load for security (prevent code execution in YAML files)
