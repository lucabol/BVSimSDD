    # Calculate overall rankings
    team_averages = []
    for i in range(len(teams)):
        avg_win_rate = sum(results_matrix[i]) / (len(teams) - 1)
        team_averages.append((teams[i].name, avg_win_rate))
    
    rankings = sort_by_win_rate_descending(team_averages)

        return False, f"Distribution sums to {total}, expected 1.0"
    
    for outcome, probability in distribution.items():
        if probability < 0.0 or probability > 1.0:
            return False, f"Invalid probability {probability} for outcome {outcome}"
    
    return True, "Valid"
```

### Team Configuration Validation

```pseudocode
function validate_team_configuration(team):
    errors = []
    
    # Validate required probability matrices exist
    required_matrices = [
        "serve_probabilities",

    return errors
```

## Performance Optimizations

### Efficient Random Sampling
- Pre-calculate cumulative probability distributions
- Use binary search for large outcome sets
- Cache probability lookups for repeated simulations

### Memory Management
- Use dataclasses for minimal overhead
- Avoid storing intermediate calculations
- Stream large simulation results to disk

### Parallel Processing Considerations
- Each point simulation is independent
- Random seed management for reproducibility
- Result aggregation patterns for large simulations
