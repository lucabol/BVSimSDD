# Integration Test Specifications

## Integration Test Philosophy

Integration tests verify that different components work together correctly and that complete user workflows function end-to-end. These tests focus on component boundaries and realistic usage scenarios.

## End-to-End User Workflow Tests

## Integration Test Execution Strategy

### Test Ordering
1. **Component Integration Tests** - Test library boundaries
2. **CLI Integration Tests** - Test command-line interfaces
3. **File I/O Integration Tests** - Test data persistence
4. **End-to-End Workflow Tests** - Test complete user scenarios
5. **Performance Integration Tests** - Test system limits
6. **Error Handling Integration Tests** - Test failure modes

### Test Environment Requirements
- Clean temporary directory for each test
- Isolated test data (no shared state between tests)
- Realistic but controlled test data
- Performance monitoring capabilities
- Cross-platform compatibility testing

### Continuous Integration
- Run integration tests after unit tests pass
- Include performance regression detection
- Test with different Python versions
- Validate cross-platform behavior
- Monitor test execution times
